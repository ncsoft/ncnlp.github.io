    "such as text generation, question answering, chatbots, summarization, and information extraction.\n",
    "NCSOFT's VARCO LLM 2.0 was developed with our own technology, including data construction, pre-training, instruction tuning and alignment tuning.\n",
    "We evaluated VARCO LLM 2.0 on various NLP tasks and its performance has significantly improved compared to VARCO LLM 1.0, and it boasts the highest performance among other Korean LLMs of similar sizes. \n",
    "In particular, it has been trained to be used in high-level natural language processing applications such as creative writing, summarization, question and answering, chatbots and translation, and shows high performance in related quantitative indicators.\n",
